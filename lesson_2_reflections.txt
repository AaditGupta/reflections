What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  I thought the answer to this question would be pretty self-explanatory, no?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
  It's an intermediary between the two. It offers value in some way that I have yet to realize.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
  I'm not sure. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organised? How would branches help?
	They would help greatly.
